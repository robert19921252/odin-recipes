    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>A delicious meal of mushroom ravioli can be easily made at home with
           only a few ingredients.
        </p>
    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>6 tablespoons butter, divided</li>
            <li>1 (8 ounce) package fresh mushrooms, finely chopped</li>
            <li>1&frac12; cups vegetable broth</li>
            <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>3 stalks scallions, chopped</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon chopped fresh sage, or to taste</li>
            <li>&frac14; teaspoon chopped fresh dill, or to taste</li>
            <li>&frac14; teaspoon chopped fresh thyme, or to taste</li>
            <li>&frac14; teaspoon chopped fresh parsley, or to taste</li>
            <li>20 (3.5 inch square) wonton wrappers</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Steps:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat 2 tablespoons butter in a saucepan over medium heat. Add mushrooms, vegetable broth, garlic, scallions, sage, dill, thyme, and parsley and cook until reduced, about 10 minutes. Separate liquid from mushrooms with a spoon and reserveâ€“this will be your sauce later. The consistency should be thin, and the color should be dark.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Spoon a small amount of mushroom filling onto one wonton. Take another and seal the two using a fork, wetting the edges with water if necessary. Repeat with remaining wrappers and filling.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Heat remaining butter in a pan over medium to medium-high heat. Add ravioli and saute until lightly browned, about 5 minutes. Drizzle sauce on top and serve.</li>
        </ol>
